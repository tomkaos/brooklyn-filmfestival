# Project Assignment

"Let's meet the client. Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organizer of this yearâ€™s Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people.
She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea!
Jennifer has a budget of \$3,500 to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations!"
